# Environmental Data - Potential for renewable energy üåé
A comprehensive collection of data, scripts, and analyses focusing on climatic conditions in Colombia and South America. This project leverages data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS), the European Union's flagship Earth observation program.
The purpose of the project was to analyze the locations in Latin America with the greatest potential for the development and implementation of renewable energy technologies, specifically wind and solar energy.

## Conclusion
### Radiation
Regarding radiation, the Latin American countries with the highest levels are Chile and Argentina. The season in which it intensifies the most is summer. Chile and northern Argentina are home to the Atacama Desert, and its Andean regions have less atmosphere to absorb radiation. It is also an area with low rainfall and relative humidity. The unique combination of tropical latitude, high altitude, extreme dryness, and permanently clear skies creates ideal conditions for maximum solar radiation in this region.
### Wind
Maps show the magnitude and direction of the winds. The darker the color, the stronger it is, and whether it is blue or red (positive or negative) indicates its direction. The wind coming from the Pacific is stopped by the Andes Mountains, and the wind coming from the Atlantic mainly affects Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia, which are coastal regions. Generally speaking, the Southern Cone (mainly Chile and Argentina) are the countries that experience the strongest winds, and these winds come from the Pacific Ocean.

In conclusion, in Latin America, the countries with the greatest opportunity to develop successful renewable energy projects are Chile and Argentina, for both wind and solar energy.
